        "discription": "Approach a job interview the way you would a test. It's important to study detailed information about the company where you're applying so you're ready to talk about how your skills are a good fit for its business. To stand out from the pack, do enough research to be able to discuss the company's recent merger or new business model, says Kelly Marinelli, principal people strategy consultant at Solve HR. It really shows your passion for the specific role and the company, and that's something that sets you apart. Besides, preparing thoroughly may help calm your nerves. You get confidence from competence, says Bill Cole, chief executive of William B. Cole Consultants.",
